## 📘 Project Description

**Hospital Emergency Case Arrival Analysis** is an individual **Minor-I Statistics Project** developed in accordance with the academic guidelines prescribed by **Rungta College of Engineering & Technology** for Semester 3 students.

This project focuses on analyzing hospital emergency case arrival data to identify **peak emergency hours**, study **time-based arrival patterns**, and perform **statistical variance analysis**. The goal is to apply fundamental statistical concepts to a real-world healthcare scenario and extract meaningful insights using data analysis and visualization techniques.

The project has been implemented independently and follows the required academic standards, including a clear project structure, readable code, and proper documentation.
